# FoC DM Bug fix

Managed to fix this according to the bug report:

"After looking for a public Deathmatch lobby and you end up hosting one (as far as my memory goes even after succesfully playing in a deathmatch) ,and then leave the lobby/ match and go back to looking for public games, the different gamemodes aren't being shown anymore and cannot be accessed."

Thanks for Explorer#6707 for this bug report :p
